# Specification Quality Checklist: Theme Spec Consolidation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-08

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | Spec focuses on user/maintainer scenarios |
| Requirement Completeness | PASS | 18 functional requirements with clear acceptance |
| Feature Readiness | PASS | 5 user stories with prioritized acceptance scenarios |

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- All edge cases documented in Edge Cases section
- Risks and mitigations clearly identified
- Backward compatibility explicitly addressed in requirements (FR-015) and success criteria (SC-005)
