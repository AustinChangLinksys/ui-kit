# Research: Table View Component

**Feature Branch**: `018-table-view`
**Status**: Skipped

## Decisions

### 1. Requirements and Strategy
- **Decision**: Research phase skipped.
- **Rationale**: Requirements and visual strategies were fully defined in the Spec (`specs/018-table-view/spec.md`) and Technical Implementation Plan. The team has clear direction on Layout Adaptation (Grid/List) and Style Differentiation (Pixel/Glass).
